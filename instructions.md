### 1. **Setup Your Environment**
   - Install **Node.js** and create a new Next.js app using `npx create-next-app`.
   - Set up **Tailwind CSS** for modern styling.

---

### 2. **Structure the Application**
   - **Pages/Components**: 
     - Home page for the password generator.
     - Separate components for different password types (e.g., Passphrase, Alphanumeric).
   - Use a state management system like React's `useState` to handle input settings dynamically.

---

### 3. **UI Layout Design**
   - **Navbar**:
     - Include app branding and a toggle for light/dark mode.
   - **Main Section**:
     - **Password Type Selector**:
       - Use tabs or dropdowns for selecting password types.
       - Options like "Passphrase", "Alphanumeric", "Special Characters", etc.
     - **Input Settings**:
       - Add sliders and toggles to customize:
         - Password length.
         - Include/exclude uppercase, numbers, and symbols.
     - **Generated Password**:
       - Display the generated password in a box.
       - Include a copy-to-clipboard button and a refresh button.
   - **Footer**:
     - Add basic credits or external links.

---

### 4. **Password Generation Logic**
   - For each password type, implement logic in utility functions:
     - **Passphrase**: Generate random words from a predefined list.
     - **Alphanumeric**: Combine letters and numbers with options for uppercase.
     - **Special Characters**: Add symbols based on user preference.
   - Ensure dynamic updates based on user inputs.

---

### 5. **Frontend Integration**
   - Bind UI controls (sliders, toggles) to the generator logic using React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`).
   - Validate user input (e.g., ensure the password length is within a reasonable range).

---

### 6. **Styling**
   - Use Tailwind CSS for utility classes:
     - Apply gradients or glassmorphism for the card layout.
     - Use responsive design to make it mobile-friendly.

---

### 7. **Testing**
   - Test the password generator for edge cases:
     - Minimum/maximum length.
     - Combinations of user inputs.
   - Ensure the generated passwords meet typical security criteria.

---

### 8. **Optimization**
   - Minify the code and optimize for fast load times using Next.js production build tools.
   - Pre-render static parts of the UI for performance.

---

### 9. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the app to **Vercel** for free hosting.
   - Set up a custom domain if needed.
